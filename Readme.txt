************************************************* Matrix Class and LU Decomposition *************************************************

A simple implementation of a matrix class in C++ with basic methods of matrix operations.

Also, there is the LU decomposition implemented in order to compute effectively the determinant. It can handle the case where the
pivot is null thanks to the switchRows method.
